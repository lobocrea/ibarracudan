## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong teal (#008080) to represent trustworthiness and efficiency, nodding subtly to classic business aesthetics but still fresh.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), offering a clean, neutral backdrop that ensures content legibility and minimizes distractions.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#D4AF37) to draw attention to key actions and data, enhancing the sense of quality.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif with a modern look suitable for both headlines and body text
- Use simple, clear icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Design Icons) for actions like 'add,' 'edit,' and 'delete'.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to organize inventory data, prioritizing readability and ease of navigation.
- Add subtle animations (e.g., a fade-in effect) when data is updated or items are added/removed to provide visual feedback.
